# Predicting Grocery Sales for Favorita Store using Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision-making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.

**In this project:**
- Cleaned and Analyzed grocery store dataset with 30 million+ rows & 19 columns to predict daily sales.
- Trained linear models, tree models, random forests, gradient-boosted trees, light GBM, and EWMA using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- Achieved a Root mean squared log error of 0.47, landing in the top 33% on Kaggle.

**Outline**
